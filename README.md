# Hi, I'm Bohdan 👋

I'm a Data Analyst with a strong interest in Python and automation.  
I enjoy working with data, finding patterns, building useful tools, and turning analysis into clear insights and visualizations.

---

## 🔍 What I do
- Analyze data and uncover meaningful insights
- Automate repetitive and manual processes
- Visualize data to support decision-making
- Experiment with new approaches to problem-solving

I’m especially motivated by projects that **simplify work**, **optimize processes**, or **offer new ways to look at problems**.

---

## 🧠 How I think
I enjoy:
- finding patterns and relationships in data  
- building logical systems and workflows  
- experimenting and iterating on ideas  
- explaining complex things in a clear and structured way  

For me, a good project is one that solves a real problem and is finished to a usable, well-documented state.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (beginner → actively improving)
- Data analysis & visualization libraries
- **SQL**
- APIs (Telegram bots, ChatGPT integrations)
- Git & GitHub

Currently focused on deepening my Python skills and building more complete, end-to-end projects.

---

## 🚀 What I'm building
This GitHub profile is a collection of projects that:
- are fully thought through and completed
- solve practical problems
- reflect my growth as an analyst and developer

Each project represents an experiment, a lesson learned, or a new way of thinking.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Strengthen Python skills through real projects
- Combine data analysis with automation and tooling
- Build a solid portfolio focused on quality, not quantity
